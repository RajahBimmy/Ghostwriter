### NYU Natural Language Processing Final Project

## Abstract

## Introduction

The question this project aimed to answer was whether or not implementation of existing Natural Language Processing algorithms could stand as at least a semi-decent substitute for actual authorship in music. Obviously our resources were limited to the research we'd done over the course of the last month in addition to any existing knowledge from class, but we figured that this would be enough to build a basic functioning system which would suit our needs.

Our personal goal was to experiment with new and exciting algorithms, grow to better understand how and why they work the way they do, and continue to develop our knowledge of the Natural Language Processing field as a whole. Lyrical generation was appealing, especially with the range of genres and artists we could work with, and the ability to see dramatic and tangible results (regardless of how coherent they turned out to be), was a major factor in our decision-making process.

The entire project sprung from a conversation between the two of us following Taylor Swift's Grammy win earlier this year (2016) for her album _1989_. Many believed that Kendrick Lamar's _To Pimp a Butterfly_ had been snubbed at the awards ceremony, and the two of us were in a heated debate. I claimed that _1989_ was a musical work of pure genius, while Carter argued that I was just buying in to cheap lyrics and weak themes, falling for Swift's same old act of repeating herself.

The position we took when facing this project was that based on the complexity and repetition of lyrics, generated text grew in coherency. The less repetitive and intricate the parts of the song were, the more easy they'd be to replicate.
