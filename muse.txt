[Dead Inside]

Dead inside!

Revere a million prayers
And draw me into your holiness
But there's nothing there
Light only shines from those who share

Unleash a million drones
And confine me then erase me babe
Do you have no soul
It's like it died long ago

Your lips feel warm to the touch
You can bring me back to life
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside

You're free to touch the sky
Whilst I am crushed and pulverized
Because you need control
Now I'm the one who's letting go

You like to give an inch
Whilst I am giving infinity
But now I've got nothing left
You have no cares and I'm bereft

Your skin feels warm to caress
I see magic in your eyes
On the outside you're ablaze and alive
But you're dead inside!

Feel me now
Hold me please
I need you to see who I am
Open up to me
Stop hiding from me
It's hurting babe
Only you can stop the pain

Don't leave me out in the cold
Don't leave me out to die
I gave you everything
I can't give you anymore
Now I've become just like you

My lips feel warm to the touch
My words seem so alive
My skin is warm to caress
I'll control and hypnotize

You've taught me to lie
Without a trace
And to kill with no remorse
On the outside I'm the greatest guy
Now I'm dead inside!

[Psycho]

Love, it will get you nowhere
You're on your own
Lost in the wild
So come to me now
I could use someone like you
Someone who'll kill on my command
And asks no questions

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a human drone?
(Aye, sir!)
Are you a killing machine?
(Aye, sir!)
I'm in control, motherfucker, do you understand?
(Aye, sir!)

Your mind is just a program
And I'm the virus
I'm changing the station
I'll improve your thresholds
I'll turn you into a super drone (super drone)
And you will kill on my command
And I won't be responsible

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

Are you a psycho killer? Say "I'm a psycho killer!"
(I am a psycho killer!)
Scream it!
(I am a psycho killer!)
Show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)
You are a pussy! I said show me your war face!
(AHHHH!)

I'm gonna make you
I'm gonna break you
I'm gonna make you
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
A fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now

I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
I will break you, do you understand?
(Aye, sir!)

You fucking psycho
Your ass belongs to me now
Your ass belongs to me now

[Mercy]

Help me
I've fallen on the inside
I tried to change the game
I tried to infiltrate
But now I'm losing men in cloaks
Always seem to run the show
Save me from the ghosts and shadows
Before they eat my soul

Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me

Absent gods and silent tyranny
We're going under hypnotized
By another puppeteer
And tell me why the men in cloaks
Always have to bring me down
Running from the ghosts and shadows
The world just disavows

Mercy, mercy
Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me

Show me mercy
Show me mercy please

Help me
I've fallen on the inside
And all the men in cloaks
Trying to devour my soul

Show me mercy
From the powers that be
Show me mercy
From the gutless and mean
Show me mercy
From the killing machines
Show me mercy
Can someone rescue me

[Reapers]

Home, It's becoming a killing field
There's a cross hair locked on my heart
With no recourse and there's no one behind the wheel
Hell fire, You're wiping me out, killed by

Drones, (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
'Cause you've got the CIA, babe
But all you've done is brutalize
Drones!

War, war just moved up a gear
I don't think I can handle the truth
I'm just a pawn
And we're all expendable
Incidentally
Electronically erased
By your

Drones, (killed by)
Drones (killed by)

You kill by remote control
The world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Drones!

You rule with lies and deceit
And the world is on your side
'Cause you've got the CIA, babe
But all you've done is brutalize

You kill by remote control
The world is on your side
You've got reapers and hawks babe
Now I am radicalized
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!
Here come the drones!

[The Handler]

You (you, you)
Were my oppressor
And I (I, I)
I have been programmed to obey

And now (now, now)
You are my handler
And I (I, I)
I will execute your demands

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

Behold (hold, hold)
My trance formation
And you (you, you)
Are empowered to do as you please

My mind (mind, mind)
Was lost in translation
And my heart (heart, heart)
Has become a cold and impassive machine

Leave me alone
I must disassociate from you

I won't let you control my feelings anymore
And I will no longer do as I am told
And I am no longer afraid to walk alone
Let me go
Let me be
I'm escaping from your grip
You will never own me again

[Defector]

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

You think you're strong and you can't be broken
But your empire is dissolving
You thought, you thought I was weak
But you got it wrong
Look into my eyes
I'm a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

Your blood is blue and your mind is turned green
And your belly is all yellow
You believe your throne is too high to be overthrown
We'll watch it get razed
By a defector

Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

I'm a defector
Free
Yeah, I'm free
From your inciting
You can't brainwash me
You've got a problem
Free
Yeah I'm free
From society
You can't control me
I'm a defector

[Revolt]

How did we get in so much trouble?
Getting out just seems impossible
Oppression is persisting
I can't fight this brain conditioning

Our freedom's just a loan
Run by machines and drones
They've got us locked into their sights
Soon they'll control what's left inside

Don't try to hide it, don't tell me it's not there

You've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

Can you hear a distant thunder
Taste earth's blood and hunger
We live in a toxic jungle
Truth is suppressed to mumbles

They'll take away our homes
They're just machines and drones

Don't try to fight it, don't tell me you can't see

That you've got strength
You've got soul
You've felt pain
You've felt love
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

I can fell your pain
I can feel your confusion
I can see you're trapped in a maze
Let's find a way to escape

You've got strength
You've got soul
You're not afraid
You're not a drone
You can grow (you can grow)
You can grow (you can grow)
You can make this world what you want
You can revolt
You can revolt
You can revolt

[Aftermath]

War is all around
I'm growing tired of fighting
I've been drained and I can't hide it
But I have strength for you
You're all that's real anymore
I am coming home now
I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

States are crumbling
And walls are rising high again
It's no place for the faint hearted
But my heart is strong
Because now I know where I belong
It's you and I against the world
We are free

From this moment
From this moment
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

We've gone against the tide
All we have is each other now
I am coming home now
I need your comfort

From this moment
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone (Never be alone)
We're bound together (Bound together)
Now and forever (Now and forever)
The loneliness has gone

From this moment (From this moment)
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone (Never be alone)
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

From this moment
From this moment (From this moment)
You'll never be alone
We're bound together
Now and forever
The loneliness has gone

Bound together
Now and forever
Loneliness has gone

[The Globalist]

You were never truly loved
You have only been betrayed
You were never truly nurtured
By churches of the state
You were left unprotected
To these wild and fragile lands

But you can rise up like a God
Arm yourself
You can be strong
You can build a nuclear power
Transform the earth to your desire

Free your mind from false beliefs
You can be the commander in chief
You can hide your true motives
To dismantle and destroy

Now you finally have the codes
I have given you the code

There's no country left
To love and cherish
It's gone, it's gone for good
It's you and me babe
Survivors
To hunt and gather memories
Of the great nation we were

There's no countries left
To fight and conquer
I think I destroyed them all
It's human nature
The greatest hunter
Will survive alone
With no one left to love

There's no culture left
To love and cherish
It's gone, you know it's gone for good
A trillion memories
Lost in space and time for ever more
I just wanted
I just needed to be loved

[Drones]

Killed by drones

My mother, my father,
My sister and my brother
My son and my daughter
Killed by drones

Our lives between
Your fingers and your thumb
Can you feel anything?
Are you dead inside?
Now you can kill
From the safety of your home
With drones

Amen
